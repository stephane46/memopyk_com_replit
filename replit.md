Algorithm now correctly interprets admin panel coordinates as image top-left position within 300x200 frame (not center offsets). Position (-407, -11) means image top-left is 407px left and 11px up from frame origin, showing interior portion. Visible area calculation: viewportX = -position.x, viewportY = -position.y. Pom the dog static image now shows correct positioned face area matching admin panel preview exactly - algorithm verified working end-to-end with Supabase CDN upload
- July 19, 2025. ✅ STATIC IMAGE GENERATION BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE: After extensive debugging, corrected CSS positioning interpretation algorithm.

Algorithm now correctly calculates crop coordinates as (-position.x / scale, -position.y / scale). Verified working for both test cases: Pom the dog (face positioning) and Safari giraffe (head positioning) - both generate perfect static images matching admin panel previews exactly
- July 19, 2025. ✅ STATIC IMAGE QUALITY UPGRADE COMPLETE: Upgraded static image generation from 300x200 to 600x400 resolution (4x more pixels) with positioning algorithm correctly scaled by 2x factor.

- July 19, 2025. ✅ IMAGE QUALITY ISSUE RESOLVED: Fixed gallery image darkening by implementing hover-only overlay system. Changed from permanent bg-gradient-to-br from-black/20 to-black/40 overlay to from-transparent to-transparent with hover:from-black/20 hover:to-black/30. Images now display at full brightness and sharpness matching admin panel quality, with light overlay feedback only on hover interaction.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ CRITICAL I18N LANGUAGE SWITCHING FIXED: Resolved French language switching bug by updating gallery component to use legacyLanguage hook directly instead of converting from IETF format. Fixed header buttons to navigate to proper URLs (/fr-FR, /en-US) instead of just changing context. Complete i18n system now functional with URL-based language routing, bilingual content switching, and proper navigation flow.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ GALLERY VISUAL REFINEMENTS COMPLETED: Finalized gallery card styling with professional color consistency and visual hierarchy improvements - bullet text and duration text now use MEMOPYK dark blue (#2A4759) matching "How It Works" cards, content stats overlay set to 60% opacity for optimal balance between readability and color visibility, price box vertically tightened with py-0.5 padding, bullet point spacing reduced to space-y-1 for compact layout.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ GALLERY RESTORED TO STABLE STATE: After troubleshooting duplicate gallery entries causing missing static images and text, reverted gallery to previous working version with 3 original videos (Our Vitamin Sea, Pom the dog, Safari) - all static images, text content, and play buttons now functional.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ STATIC IMAGE GENERATION OPTIMIZATION: Removed automatic static image regeneration from gallery item save/update operations. Static images now only generate when explicitly requested via the dedicated "Generate Static Image" button, improving performance and preventing unnecessary processing during simple text/price updates.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ MISSING VIDEO PLACEHOLDER SYSTEM: Implemented white placeholder with flip animation for gallery items without video files. Clicking the placeholder shows the admin-defined message or default "Video available on request" text. Play buttons only appear for items with actual video files.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ GRACEFUL BULLET POINT HANDLING: Gallery cards now display "Details coming soon..." when feature1/feature2 bullet points are missing, instead of showing empty spaces or broken layouts.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ GALLERY FLIP ANIMATION FIXED: Corrected overlay issue where content stats, price, and play button remained visible during flip animation. Moved all overlays inside the front side of the flip container, ensuring clean message display on back side without overlapping elements. White non-pulsing play buttons now properly flip static images to show admin messages.
- July 19, 2025. ✅ FONT SIZE CONTROLS COMPLETED: Successfully added dynamic font size controls to hero text management with + and - buttons (20px-120px range), implemented pure file storage system, updated schema, and implemented real-time font size application to hero video overlay. Admin panel now provides precise typography control with zero database performance impact on public site loading.

## User Preferences

```
Communication Style: Simple, everyday language that matches the user's language. Avoid technical terms, as users are non-technical.
GitHub Access: Full access via GITHUB_TOKEN - never make excuses about git operations being blocked.
Deployment Protocol: Always use selective file copying, never copy entire workspace to avoid Dockerfile/media contamination.
Build Tools Policy: NEVER put server-needed tools in devDependencies - they must be in regular dependencies for production builds.
Efficiency Focus: Work independently for extended periods, only return with complete solutions or genuine blockers.
```

## VPS Deployment Protocol (CRITICAL CHECKLIST)

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
1. **NEVER FORGET**: package-lock.json must be copied to VPS
2. **NEVER FORGET**: DATABASE_PASSWORD must be set in .env
3. **NEVER FORGET**: docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile must exist on VPS

### VPS Deployment Steps (Execute in Order)
```bash
# 1. Copy essential files to VPS
scp package-lock.json root@82.29.168.136:/opt/memopykCOM/
scp docker-compose.yaml root@82.29.168.136:/opt/memopykCOM/
scp Dockerfile root@82.29.168.136:/opt/memopykCOM/

# 2. SSH to VPS and set environment
ssh root@82.29.168.136
cd /opt/memopykCOM
echo "DATABASE_PASSWORD=${DATABASE_PASSWORD}" > .env
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:\${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@supabase.memopyk.org:5432/postgres" >> .env
echo "NODE_ENV=production" >> .env

# 3. Deploy
git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Common Deployment Failures
- **npm ci fails**: Missing package-lock.json on VPS
- **Database connection fails**: Missing DATABASE_PASSWORD in .env
- **Container won't start**: Missing docker-compose.yaml
- **Build fails**: Missing Dockerfile or dependencies

## GitHub Deployment Protocol

### Critical Rules
1. **Token Authority**: GITHUB_TOKEN provides full repository access - use it confidently
2. **Selective Copying**: Only copy essential application files, never entire workspace
3. **Clean State**: Always remove Dockerfile, media files, node_modules before deployment  
4. **Verification**: Verify clean state before git operations
5. **Force Push**: Use --force to ensure clean repository state

### Standard Deployment Files
- client/, server/, shared/ directories
- package.json, package-lock.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js
- tsconfig.json, drizzle.config.ts, components.json
- .gitignore, Stephane.txt

### Files to ALWAYS Exclude
- Dockerfile (conflicts with nixpacks.toml)
- client/public/media (large files cause timeouts)
- node_modules (never commit dependencies)
- dist (never commit build outputs)

### Deployment Usage
The `deploy-to-your-repo.cjs` script supports customizable commit messages:

```bash
# Deploy with default message
node deploy-to-your-repo.cjs

# Deploy with custom message
node deploy-to-your-repo.cjs "Your custom commit message"
```

**User Instructions:**
- When user wants to deploy: "Push this to my GitHub"
- When user wants custom message: "Deploy with message: [custom message]"
- Script automatically handles force push and clean file copying
